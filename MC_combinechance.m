%MC_MAXCHANCE test the significance level that a set of combined events is
%prefered or not prefered. The null hypothesis is that all events have
%equal chances
%output:
%       nn: The number of occurrences for the combined event in each test [1xNtest]
%       pn: The number of occurrences for the target combine event at selected
%       significance level [2xNp]: row 1 is the occurrence if the target
%       event is perfered, row 2 is the occurrence if the target
%       event is not perfered
%input:
%       Nsampe: sample size in each test.
%       Ntest: the number of times to repeat the test
%       Neventï¼šthe total types of events
%       Ncombine: 
%       ptest: the siginificance level to test [1xNp]
